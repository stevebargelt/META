# Project Retrospective: [Project Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration:** [How long project took]
**Status:** [Completed / Paused / Ongoing]

## What We Built

[2-3 sentence summary of what was accomplished]

**Key features/components:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

## What Worked

### Agent Usage
- **[Agent]** excelled at [specific task]
- Multi-agent flow [describe successful workflow]
- Example: [Specific instance where approach worked well]

### Technical Choices
- [Tech/pattern] worked well for [use case]
- [Decision] saved time/complexity

### Process Wins
- [Process or workflow that was effective]
- [Tool or technique that helped]

## What Didn't Work

### Agent Issues
- **[Agent]** struggled with [specific task]
- Context handoffs were [problem description]
- Example: [Specific instance where approach failed]

### Technical Challenges
- [Tech/pattern] caused issues with [problem]
- [Decision] we'd reconsider because [reason]

### Process Problems
- [Process or workflow that hindered]
- [Tool or technique that didn't help]

## Patterns Added to META

- `patterns/[category]/[name].md` — [What pattern, why useful]
- Updated `agents/[agent].md` — [What changed, why]

## Agent Evolution

### Updates Made
- **base.md:** [Change and rationale]
- **[agent].md:** [Change and rationale]

### New Learnings
- [Insight about when to use which agent]
- [Insight about model selection]
- [Insight about workflows]

## Model Performance

| Task | Model Used | Rating | Notes |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| [Task] | [Model] | ⭐⭐⭐ | [What worked/didn't] |
| [Task] | [Model] | ⭐⭐⭐ | [What worked/didn't] |

## Metrics

- **Time saved:** [Estimate vs without AI]
- **Iterations:** [How many major revisions]
- **Context resets:** [How many times hit context limits]
- **Model switches:** [How often switched models]

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Approach Chosen | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| [What] | [Choice] | [Why] | [Result] |

## Reusable Assets

- Code patterns: [What can be reused]
- Prompts: [Effective prompts to save]
- Configurations: [Configs worth keeping]

## Would Do Differently

1. [Thing 1] — [Why and what instead]
2. [Thing 2] — [Why and what instead]

## Would Do Same

1. [Thing 1] — [Why it worked]
2. [Thing 2] — [Why it worked]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Update `learnings/what-works.md` with [insight]
- [ ] Update `learnings/what-doesnt.md` with [anti-pattern]
- [ ] Update `learnings/model-comparison.md` with [finding]
- [ ] Add patterns to `patterns/` if applicable
