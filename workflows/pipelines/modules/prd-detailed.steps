# PRD Detailed Module (Reference Only)
# This module documents the interactive flow - it does NOT get copied into pipelines
# The project-orchestrator runs this flow conversationally before pipeline generation

# INTERACTIVE FLOW (runs before pipeline)
# ========================================
#
# This is NOT a pipeline step. It's an interactive conversation facilitated by
# the project-orchestrator agent using prompts/prd-detailed-questions.md.
#
# Flow:
#
# 1. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (product-researcher agent, ~20-30 min)
#    - Search for competitors in the product category
#    - Analyze 3-5 alternatives
#    - Create docs/COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md
#    - Report findings to conversation
#
# 2. REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION (project-orchestrator, ~30-45 min)
#    - Ask questions from prompts/prd-detailed-questions.md
#    - Categories: Problem Space, Target Users, Success Criteria, Constraints, Scope
#    - Adapt questions based on answers and research findings
#    - Capture decisions explicitly
#
# 3. DRAFT PRD (project-orchestrator, ~15 min)
#    - Synthesize answers + research into PRD
#    - Use prompts/prd-template.md structure
#    - Include Competitive Context section
#    - Present draft in conversation
#
# 4. REVIEW LOOP (project-orchestrator + human, variable)
#    - Human provides feedback
#    - Agent revises PRD
#    - Repeat until human approves
#    - Common revisions: scope adjustments, criteria refinement, metric changes
#
# 5. FINALIZE
#    - Write approved PRD to docs/PRD-<feature-name>.md
#    - Update .meta/handoff.md with summary
#    - Proceed to Architecture phase (or pipeline)
#
# Artifacts Created:
# - docs/COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md (from research phase)
# - docs/PRD-<feature-name>.md (final approved PRD)
#
# Time Estimate: 1-2 hours depending on complexity and review iterations
#
# When to Use:
# - Requirements are unclear or need exploration
# - Entering unfamiliar problem space
# - Competitive landscape matters
# - User wants to think through requirements interactively
