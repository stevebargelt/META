description: End-to-end new project kickoff and build orchestration
timeout_min: 90

# NUM | AGENT | CLI | GATE | PARALLEL_GROUP | TIMEOUT_MIN | PROMPT
1 | base            | interactive | auto | - | 45 | Run kickoff using ../META/prompts/kickoff.md (adjust path if needed). Ask questions in the tmux step window, write AGENTS.md, ensure CLAUDE.md is a symlink, and summarize answers in .handoff.md. Exit the session when done.
2 | base            | interactive | auto | - | 30 | External services setup. Read .handoff.md and confirm external integrations (e.g., Supabase). If any, ask for setup details, create/update .env.example and a setup note in docs/SETUP.md. Use META/prompts/external-service-setup-checklist.md. If none, note "no external services" in .handoff.md. Exit when complete.
3 | product-manager | - | auto | - | 45 | Create docs/PRD.md from kickoff answers in .handoff.md. Update .handoff.md with scope and open questions.
4 | architect       | - | gate | - | 45 | Design architecture from PRD. Create ARCHITECTURE.md and update .handoff.md with decisions.
5 | orchestrator    | - | gate | - | 45 | Create a build plan and write it to .meta/next.pipeline using the pipeline format in ../META/plans/meta-cli-orchestration.md (adjust path if needed). Include name/description/timeout_min and sequential step numbers starting at 1. Use only these agent names: base, product-manager, architect, tester, reviewer, debugger, documenter, orchestrator. If you plan any PARALLEL_GROUPs, add a contract stub step before parallel work (use META/prompts/contract-stub.md; prefer OpenAPI). Identify independent workstreams and assign PARALLEL_GROUP labels (e.g., client vs server). If no parallelism is safe, explain why in .handoff.md and include the "Parallelization Decision" template from agents/orchestrator.md. Include a Definition-of-Done checklist step (use META/prompts/definition-of-done-checklist.md) with a gate near the end of the pipeline. Update .handoff.md with the plan summary.
